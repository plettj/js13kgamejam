# Game Jam

### Concept:

- Open-world platformer, with a sort of heaven-hell visual and storyline theme.
- You can die from losing all your health... but also from gaining *too much* health! Your survival is an eternal balance between extremes.
- This means there are two types of enemies: ones that add health and ones that take it away.
- If you have low health, "good" enemies start becoming "bad" enemies so it's even harder for you to return to equilibrium.
- When you start, there is either a ghost [or possibly two, one enlightened one and one death one??] that chases you, or some sort of counter, forcing you to fail early.
- After dying early, though, you can use what you collected to invest in your future attempts to survive, by buying power-ups and related paraphernalia.
- That way, you die often, but each time, you improve and survive longer. So you're working towards some sort of accomplishment...
- Which is unlocking a cage to a character near the start. But you need a key, so the whole game is the quest to go get and return with that key!

##### Enemies

- Angels + Devils, that travel around and shoot beams at you
- Road Paved in Gold + Fire, that affects health as you move over it
- Gumbas (good + evil versions), or other types, that just walk around and stuff

##### Power-ups
