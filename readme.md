### Concept:

Actually trying to make your character die [make spikes appear and avoid angels].
Initially it seems normal, but its a loop and the only way out is to die... which brings you to a "shadow realm."
An extension of the above idea, but there's tiers of deathness that you can move up and down through, physically and conceptually.
The closer you are to enlightenment, the more power you have.
Action game... where every time you die, you learn more about the levels each time you go.
Your health is decreasing, so you want to "survive" as long as you can in order to die.
Thread the needle between enlightenment and early death, in order to get to the end.
Every time you do something that gives you an advantage, you lose time in that attempt, but gain future chances.

- Open-world platformer, with a sort of heaven-hell visual and storyline theme.
- You can die from losing all your health... but also from gaining *too much* health! Your survival is an eternal balance between extremes.
- This means there are two types of enemies: ones that add health and ones that take it away.
- If you have low health, "good" enemies start becoming "bad" enemies so it's even harder for you to return to equilibrium.
- When you start, there is either a ghost [or possibly two, one enlightened one and one death one??] that chases you, or some sort of counter, forcing you to fail early.
- After dying early, though, you can use what you collected to invest in your future attempts to survive, by buying power-ups and related paraphernalia.
- That way, you die often, but each time, you improve and survive longer. So you're working towards some sort of accomplishment...
- Which is unlocking a cage to a character near the start. But you need a key, so the whole game is the quest to go get and return with that key!

##### Enemies

- Angels + Devils, that travel around and shoot beams at you
- Road Paved in Gold + Fire, that affects health as you move over it
- Gumbas (good + evil versions), or other types, that just walk around and stuff

##### Power-ups

-
